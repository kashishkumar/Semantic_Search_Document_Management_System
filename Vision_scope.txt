Vision - Build a semantic search based query engine for quotation, importer Agreement and taxinvoice using large language model 

Scope -
1. Can read word, excel, pdf, csv files for information
2. Use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to build a query engine for the documents | If required model finetuning can be done 
3. Have a vector database for the query system to have semantic search
4. Use LLama2 model as the large language model for the query system
5. No external API calls can be made since the data is confidential
6. In house deployment on a CPU server 
7. Backend API to be built for the query system
8. Frontend to be built by the client using C# or any other language





Questions ?
1. Do we want separate model for each document type ?
2. Do we want to use RAG or finetuning of the model ?
